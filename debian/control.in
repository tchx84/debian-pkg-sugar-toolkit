Description: Sugar Learning Platform - legacy core widgets
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 This package contains a deprecated set of widgets to build HIG
 compliant applications and interfaces to interact with system services
 like presence and the datastore.  Please use python-sugar3 instead
 where possible.
