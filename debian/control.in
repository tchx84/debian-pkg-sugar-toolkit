Description: Sugar graphical shell - core widgets
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as intregral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-ressource desktop
 environment for kids.
 .
 This package contains a set of widgets to build HIG compliant
 applications and interfaces to interact with system services like
 presence and the datastore.
