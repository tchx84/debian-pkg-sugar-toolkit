Description: Sugar graphical shell - core widgets
 Sugar is a desktop environment. It is conceived as a platform upon
 which children learn with Sugar Activities. The platform provides
 mechanisms for collaboration, reflection, and exploration. Sugar
 Activities cover a broad range of applications: browsing, drawing,
 composing, writing, programming, etc.
 .
 This package contains a set of widgets to build HIG compliant
 applications and interfaces to interact with system services like
 presence and the datastore.
